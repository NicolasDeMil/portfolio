      Hello everyone and welcome to my portfolio :)
      I was born in Paris from a French dad and a Filipino mom. I grew up in Tokyo until I was 16 and then moved to Singapore where I finished my secondary education with honors on the French Baccalaureat.
      I then went on to the Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne in Switzerland, where I graduated from an International Hospitality Management degree with Honors. During this time, I realized my real passion lied in Technology and Games. I learned Python online and I managed to get into the Computer Science program at the National University of Singapore.
      It was a great experience however after 2 semesters I felt it was not the right environment for me to flourish.
      I decided to get a job that would help improve my weaknesses of communication and help me overcome my shyness.
      I moved to London and found work as a Sales Executive in a SaaS Technology firm. 
      I stayed there for one and a half years however in order to get back to my core passions, I decided to pursue a career as a self taught developper and took online courses between working part-time jobs at cafes and restaurants. 
      I then found out about a bootcamp that would help me in jumpstarting my career as a dev. I immediately applied and 9-weeks later, I'm more ready than I've ever been to start my career in this industry. 
      Now you're all caught up!

        <h3 class="py-3">ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>Full Stack Developer</p>
        1. Games & Technology
        Always been a massive video game fan. From a very young age waking up at 6am to cheat my allocated number of hours allowed of playing per day to the present. I love the fantasy and the alternate realities but mostly I love the fact that everyone can use them and that they bring people together. I've created mazes, board games, and started working on an iOS app in the format of a Choose Your Own Adventure game. At the moment, I am learning to use Unity to design, create and share my latest creations.
        2. Design & Creativity
        Design is something I've recently come to appreciate. I've always been interested in the Arts and creative, even attempted beeing part of a Manga creation club at school, but unfortunately I was not particularly gifted at drawing and didn't put in the work needed to get better. I left this part of my life on the side for a while to focus on the Sciences however while working on my personal development projects I have greatly enjoyed working on the front-end aspects. I've also done a number of personality and career tests that all place my affinity with Art very highly.
        3. Learning & Self-Development
        I love learning new things. Whether it's reading the whole Wikipedia page of the colour blue, learning song lyrics to impress my friends at karaoke, or learning about ethical hacking, it keeps me engaged and motivated. I've always considered my brain to be one of my biggest assets so I like to develop it and grow. The more you learn, the more you learn. Coding has endless possibilities, which is one of the reasons I enjoy it so much. 
        4. PopCulture, Food & Cinema
        I identify as a millenial. Growing up with technology I've always had access to information and as a result I've been exposed to pop culture from a young age and am a big follower of the movement. From music, to restaurants, to cinema, it's a big interest of mine. I love reviewing places I've been, or movies I've watched and it's the main reason I created itsblueandyou. I find that you can never find reviews you need as everyone has different perspectives, but with sharing your reviews with a like-minded community becomes easier to understand each other.
