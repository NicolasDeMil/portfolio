      Hello everyone and welcome to my portfolio :)
      I've had somewhat of a peculiar journey:
      I was born in Paris from a French dad and a Filipino mom. I grew up in Tokyo until I was 16 and then moved to Singapore where I finished my secondary education with honors on the French Baccalaureat.
      I then went on to Switzerland, where I graduated from an International Hospitality Management degree with Honors at the Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne. During my time at university, I realized my real passions lied in Technology and Games. I learned Python online and after applying to different schools (and to everyone's surprise, including myself,) I got into the Computer Science program at the National University of Singapore. It was an amazing experience, (but unfortunately once again, didn't feel like it was the right place for me.) So after 2 semesters I decided it was time for me to start my career and get a job!
      I wanted to improve on my weaknesses of communication and overcome my shyness so I moved to London and worked as a Sales Executive in a SaaS Technology firm for one and a half years. 
      I order to get back to my core passions, I resigned and decided to pursue a career as a self taught developper and took online course between working part time jobs at cafes and restaurants. I then found out about a bootcamp that would help me in jumpstarting my career. I immediately applied and 9-weeks later, I'm more ready than I've ever been to start my career in this industry. 
      Now you're all caught up :)

        <h3 class="py-3">ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>Full Stack Developer</p>
        1. Games (Technology)
        Always been a massive video game fan. From a very young age waking up at 6am to cheat my allocated number of hours allowed of playing per day to the present. I love the fantasy and the alternate realities but mostly I love the fact that everyone can use them and that they bring people together. I've created mazes, board games, and started working on an iOS app in the format of a Choose Your Own Adventure game. At the moment, I am learning to use Unity to design, create and share my latest creations.
        2. Design
        Design is something I've recently come to appreciate. I've always been interested in the Arts and creative, even attempted beeing part of a Manga creation club at school, but unfortunately I was not particularly gifted at drawing and didn't put in the work needed to get better. I left this part of my life on the side for a while to focus on the Sciences however while working on my personal development projects I have greatly enjoyed working on the front-end aspects. I've also done a number of personality and career tests that all place my affinity with Art very highly.
        3. Learning
        I love learning new things. Whether it's reading the whole Wikipedia page of the colour blue, learning song lyrics to impress my friends at karaoke, or learning about ethical hacking, it keeps me engaged and motivated. I've always considered my brain to be one of my biggest assets so I like to develop it and grow. The more you learn, the more you learn. Coding has endless possibilities, which is one of the reasons I enjoy it so much. 
        4. Technology - Music - Films - Reviews - Creative Arts (PopCulture)
